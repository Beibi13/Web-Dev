    <h1> A Happy Child by Anonymous</h1>
    <p> My house is red - a little house <br>
A happy child am I.<br>
I laugh and play the whole day long,<br>
I hardly ever cry.<br>

I have a tree, a green, green tree,<br>
To shade me from the sun;<br>
And under it I often sit,<br>
When all my play is done. </p>
